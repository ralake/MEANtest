MEANtest
========
 
A small exercise in creating a MEANstack app based on this [tutorial](https://scotch.io/tutorials/build-a-restful-api-using-node-and-express-4)

It served its purpose as a good intro to MEAN but I had to mould some elements together to make it work and take some elements of the tutorial out.

There is also a redirect in a route which isn't very 'angular'
